# Overview

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable website so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, an attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

You can find more details at [PortSwigger Web Security Academy: Cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting).

This page contains recommendations for the implementation of protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

- Make sure all variables go through input validation and are then escaped or sanitized. 
- Implement input validation, see the [Input Validation](/Web%20Application/Input%20Validation/README.md) page.
- Implement output encoding, see the [Output Encoding](/Web%20Application/Output%20Encoding/README.md) page.
- Implement HTML sanitization, see [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).
- Comply with requirements from the [Cookie Security](/Web%20Application/Cookie%20Security/README.md) page.
- Enforce strict Content Security Policy, see the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](/Web%20Application/Content%20Security%20Policy%20(CSP)/README.md) page.
